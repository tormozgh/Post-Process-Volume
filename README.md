Post Process Volume
A custom tool for TouchDesigner that lets you apply effects to a specific region of your 3D environment. These effects can be either the built-in cinematic presets included in the component, or custom effects you provide as an input.

The component is inspired by Unreal Engineâ€™s Post Process Volume, bringing a similar workflow into Touchdesigner.
